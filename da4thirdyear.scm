 Binary Tree: Family Tree : Descendent Tree
Question: Consider male members of a family with father-son relationship only, where at the maximum there are only two sons for a father. All the family members have unique names (you may assume that all have first names only). Person A is the ancestor of Person B if A is father / grand father / great grand father etc. of B. Person A is the descendent of person B if A is the son / grand son / great grand son etc. of B.Represent the family as a rooted binary tree; you must write all the necessary constructors and selectors.

1. Given a family and the name of a person, find the names of all his descendents.   
2. Given a family and the name of a person, find the names of all his descendents who have no sons.   
3. Given a family and the names of two persons, find their nearest common ancestor.
